		Filename Conventions
		--------------------

.hpp = C++ header file that can be #included
.cpp = implementation header for C++ template code
       (not generally #included by user code)

.cc  = C++ code compiled into a program or library




		Documentation Conventions
		-------------------------

Borrowed from xengine:

* All namespaces must have a brief and detailed description.

* All classes that belong to the public interface must have a brief
  and detailed description that is usually put right in front of the
  class declaration in the header file. The brief descriptions must be
  specified by using the \brief tag (because of a bug in doxygen).

* All member functions that are part of the public interface of a
  class must have a brief description in the header file. This can
  either be put right in front of the method declaration or right
  after it on the same line with a //!< comment. A detailed
  description, if applicable, must be put just before the method
  definition in the implementation file.

* The documentation for public member variables or static class
  variables may comprise only a brief description and need not have a
  detailed description. Brief and detailed descriptions are either
  just before the declaration or on the same line right after the
  declaration of the variable. Note that public member variables
  should not be used in general.
