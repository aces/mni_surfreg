		New in Version 0.4

* sphere-register supports the standard BIC options like -verbose, -debug, etc.
Debug output from surftracc is no longer emitted by default; use -debug option
with sphere-register to obtain it.

* sphere-register supports registration of input surfaces with 1280 facets,
5120 facets, up to 320k facets.  This is detected automatically.

* initial-surface-map is able to flip mapping along any of the three axes.
Flipping along X can be useful for left-right comparison.

* Documentation on the theory underlying the registration process available
in directory doc.


		New in Version 0.3

* surface-distance-transform-1 has a new option -dt_extra
This is useful for reducing the memory consumption when computing
for a surface with a large number of triangles.

* better diagnostics for all executables
