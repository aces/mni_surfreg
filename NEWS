		New in Version 0.6

* New license Copyright Alan C. Evans

* Add depth_potential by Maxime Boucher

		New in Version 0.5.1

* Make arithmetic test in surflib/Search.cpp less sensitive to
  truncation error (would cause endless loop on RedHat systems).

		New in Version 0.5

* tools/alpha-shape.cc: Change kernel K to filtered kernel based on
  CGAL::Cartesian, rather than Exact_predicates_inexact_constructions_kernel 
  which uses Simple_cartesian.  We need handle/rep kernel in order to use
  K::Point_3 as map key.

* surflib/test/tester_approx.hpp: Rmove now-unused specialization
  of assertion_traits<double>.

* surflib/test/t_surface_algebra.cc:
* surflib/test/t_Vector_s.cc:
* surflib/test/t_ShortestPathQuery.cc:
* surflib/test/t_Point_s.cc:
* surflib/test/t_Facet_coordinate_frame.cc: Use
  Halfedge::halfedge(), t1(), etc rather than directly accessing
  member variable.  Use CPPUNIT_ASSERT_DOUBLES_EQUAL() rather than
  CPPUNIT_ASSERT_EQUAL() with specialized assertion_traits<double>.

* surflib/test/Makefile.am: Add -DCGAL_MP_FLOAT_ALLOW_INEXACT to
  dividing an MP_Float by a double; required for some tests.

* surflib/rotation.hpp (rotate): Reverse order of declaration for
  () overloads.  These are templated functions and "two stage
  lookup" requires that references not dependent on a template
  parameter be defined at point of reference.

* tools/alpha-shape.cc: Change kernel from Cartesian<MP_Float> to
  Exact_predicates_inexact_constructions_kernel.  The former no
  longer works in CGAL 3.2.1 because there is no division without
  CGAL_MP_FLOAT_ALLOW_INEXACT.

		New in Version 0.4

* sphere-register supports the standard BIC options like -verbose, -debug, etc.
Debug output from surftracc is no longer emitted by default; use -debug option
with sphere-register to obtain it.

* sphere-register supports registration of input surfaces with 1280 facets,
5120 facets, up to 320k facets.  This is detected automatically.

* initial-surface-map is able to flip mapping along any of the three axes.
Flipping along X can be useful for left-right comparison.

* Documentation on the theory underlying the registration process available
in directory doc.


		New in Version 0.3

* surface-distance-transform-1 has a new option -dt_extra
This is useful for reducing the memory consumption when computing
for a surface with a large number of triangles.

* better diagnostics for all executables
